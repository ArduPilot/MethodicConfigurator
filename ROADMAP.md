# Roadmap

This document outlines the planned development directions for the ArduPilot
Methodic Configurator project.
Our goal is to provide comprehensive, automated
configuration assistance for ArduPilot users across all vehicle types.

## Current Focus Areas

### Improved Automation

We are actively working to enhance automation in key configuration areas:

#### ESC Configuration

- **Goal**: Develop intelligent ESC (Electronic Speed Controller) configuration wizards
- **Benefits**: Reduce manual parameter tuning, minimize setup errors, optimize performance

#### Notch Filter Configuration

- **Goal**: Automated notch filter setup for vibration dampening and noise reduction
- **Benefits**: Improved flight stability, automatic frequency detection, reduced pilot workload

## Future Vehicle Support Expansion

Currently, the ArduPilot Methodic Configurator primarily supports ArduCopter.
We plan to extend support to additional ArduPilot vehicle types:

### Planned Vehicle Support

- **ArduPlane** (fixed-wing aircraft)
- **Rover** (ground vehicles)
- **Helicopter** (rotary-wing aircraft)
- **ArduSub** (submarine vehicles)
- **Boat** (surface water vehicles)
- **Blimp** (lighter-than-air vehicles)

### Implementation Approach

- Create vehicle-specific configuration templates
- Develop vehicle-appropriate parameter sets
- Add vehicle-specific automation features
- Ensure compatibility with ArduPilot's vehicle-specific firmware

## How You Can Help

We need contributors to help realize this roadmap! Here's how you can get involved:

### For Vehicle Support Expansion

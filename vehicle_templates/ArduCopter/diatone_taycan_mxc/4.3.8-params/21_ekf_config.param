# Accelerometer noise (m/s^2)
# This control disturbance noise controls the growth of estimated error due to accelerometer measurement
# errors excluding bias. Increasing it makes the flter trust the accelerometer measurements less and other
# measurements more.
# Range: 0.01 1.0
# Increment: 0.01
# Units: m/s/s (meters per square second)
# Default: 0.35
EK3_ACC_P_NSE,0.35  # higher value -> trust accelerometer less, compared to other sources

# Altitude measurement noise (m)
# This is the RMS value of noise in the altitude measurement. Increasing it reduces the weighting of the
# baro measurement and will make the filter respond more slowly to baro measurement errors, but will make
# it more sensitive to GPS and accelerometer errors. A larger value for EK3_ALT_M_NSE may be required when
# operating with EK3_SRCx_POSZ = 0. This parameter also sets the noise for the 'synthetic' zero height
# measurement that is used when EK3_SRCx_POSZ = 0.
# Range: 0.1 100.0
# Increment: 0.1
# Units: m (meters)
# Default: 2
EK3_ALT_M_NSE,2  # lower value -> trust baro more, compared to other sources

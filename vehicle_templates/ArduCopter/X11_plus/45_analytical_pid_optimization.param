# Arm Checks to Perform (bitmask)
# Checks prior to arming motor. This is a bitmask of checks that will be performed before allowing arming.
# For most users it is recommended to leave this at the default of 1 (all checks enabled). You can select
# whatever checks you prefer by adding together the values of each check type to set this parameter. For
# example, to only allow arming when you have GPS lock and no RC failsafe you would set ARMING_CHECK to 72.
# Bitmask: 0:All,1:Barometer,2:Compass,3:GPS lock,4:INS,5:Parameters,6:RC Channels,7:Board voltage,8:Battery Level,10:Logging Available,11:Hardware safety switch,12:GPS Configuration,13:System,14:Mission,15:Rangefinder,16:Camera,17:AuxAuth,18:VisualOdometry,19:FFT
# Default: 1
ARMING_CHECK,1  # Normal state for everyday use

# Rate Feedforward Enable
# Controls whether body-frame rate feedforward is enabled or disabled
# 0: Disabled
# 1: Enabled
# Default: 1
ATC_RATE_FF_ENAB,1  # Restore value now that system identification is done

# Acceleration (vertical) controller I gain
# Acceleration (vertical) controller I gain.  Corrects long-term difference in desired vertical
# acceleration and actual acceleration
# Range: 0.000 3.000
# Default: 1
PSC_ACCZ_I,0.816  # now that system identification on thrust has been completed, restore it to 2 â€¢ MOT_THST_HOVER

# System identification axis
# Controls which axis are being excited.  Set to non-zero to see more parameters

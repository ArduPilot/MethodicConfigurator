# Altitude change
# Altitude change to be commanded during the figure-8 pattern to capture mag field changes during throttle
# changes. Starting altitude is based upon the entry waypointâ€™s altitude, and the Copter will climb this
# amount ABOVE that starting altitude on occasion.
# Units: m
# Range: 0 100
# Default: 10
MAGH_ALT_DELTA,10 # Height difference between the highest and lowest point of the eight

# Figure 8 Geometric factor
# Geometric factor to adjust the width of the figure-8. Values of 1.2-1.5 should be more than adequate.
# Range: 1.2 1.5
# Default: 1.2
MAGH_B,1.2 # Geometric factor for the width of the eight

# SCRIPT_TIME command
# The SCRIPT_TIME command value used to initiate the scripted pattern. Defaults to 117.
# Range: 0 255
# Default: 117
MAGH_CMD,117 # Script_Time command value for identification of the script

# Repeat count
# Number of times to repeat the figure-8. If battery failsafes are properly configured, you can make this
# number somewhat high so that the figure-8 will be repeated until failsafe.
# Range: 1 20
# Default: 6
MAGH_COUNT,6 # Number of times the drone repeats the eight

# Enable MAGH.Active logging
# Enable a MAGH.Active value to be logged in dataflash for later consumption. Set 0 for no logging.
# Range: 0 1
# Default: 1
MAGH_LOG_ENABLE,1 # Activates the logging of the MAGH.Active message

# Minimum speed
# Starting speed (m/s) for the figure-8. Speed will slowly increment to WPNAV_SPEED as the pattern is
# repeated. Defaults to 1/2 of WPNAV_SPEED.
# Units: m/s
# Default: 1/2 of WPNAV_SPEED
MAGH_MIN_SPEED,5 # Starting speed for the mission; slowly adjusts to the general speed in auto-missions

# Number of waypoint in figure 8
# The number of waypoints to be used in defining the figure-8. Use more points for a smoother path at the
# cost of potentially slower speed during navigation. Defaults to 18. 16-24 should be adequate for most
# cases.
# Range: 16 24
# Default: 18
MAGH_NUM_WP,18 # Number of waypoints from which the eight is built

# Use loiter
# Insert a LOITER_UNLIMITED waypoint prior to the figure-8 so that the new waypoints can be downloaded and
# verified prior to continuing. Set 0 to disable (not recommended). See the end of the writeup for a helper
# script to advance waypoints via an RC switch.
# Range: 0 1
# Default: 1
MAGH_USE_LOITER,0 # Sets a Loiter_unlimited command at the beginning of the mission to check the generated waypoints

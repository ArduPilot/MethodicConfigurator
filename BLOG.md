# How to methodically tune (almost) any multicopter using ArduCopter 4.4.x

![Cinewhoop Diatone Taycan MX-C](cinewhoop.png)

For illustrative purposes, we will use the small 3'' multicopter depicted above, but the tuning sequence we developed at [IAV GmbH](https://www.iav.com/) will work on almost any other multicopter.
This method uses the latest available [ArduPilot WebTools](https://firmware.ardupilot.org/Tools/WebTools/), some of the new features of ArduCopter 4.3 and best practices from the [Ardupilot Community](https://discuss.ardupilot.org/).

We will detail the firmware parameters to change, the sequence of how to change them, help you to find the value for each parameter,
 explain which test flights to conduct and the order in which to conduct them and help you document all your steps for traceability.
This applies industry-proven [*software configuration management* (SCM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_configuration_management) techniques to tuning an ArduCopter vehicle.
You will be able to tune multiple vehicles (think production line) using this method and still have individual traceability of each parameter change on each vehicle.

# 1. Getting the hardware right

Some rules of thumb for hardware requirements:

1. **Robust frame construction:** A stable and rigid frame is crucial for stable and safe flight behavior. Carbon frames are recommended but not essential, and remember carbon is an electrical conductor.
2. **ESC telemetry:** Use only ESCs that provide at least RPM telemetry. It simplifies Notch filter tuning and improves its response-time and accuracy.
3. **Vibration reduction:** Vibrations reduce the efficiency, stability and lifespan of the drone. All propellers must be carefully balanced. They are the source of most of the vibrations. All components must be securely fastened to minimize vibrations and avoid damage caused by vibrations.
4. **Protection of sensors from external disturbances:**
    1. **Vibration-dampening mounting of the FC**
    1. **Separation of compass and high-current paths:** To reduce electromagnetic interference, it is recommended to spatially separate the compass (likely integrated with [GNSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_navigation) receivers) from high-current paths and magnetic sources such as motors and power distribution systems/cables.
    1. **Protection of barometer from airflow:** The barometer must be protected from wind and airflow or turbulence generated by the propellers. A small piece of open-cell foam placed over the sensor acts as a low-pass filter, ensuring accurate altitude measurements.
    1. **GNSS systems are likely to be affected by USB3 devices.** Keep possible negative influences in mind while using USB3 components.
5. **Proper cable management:** Cables and wires must be organized sensibly to prevent entanglement or damage during flight. It must be ensured that no cables hinder movable parts such as propellers or gimbal mechanisms, or are damaged by them. Flexible, silicone-coated cables for data transfer save weight and reduce vibration transmission. Weak connectors are prone to loosening under the influence of vibration.
6. **Weight distribution:** An even weight distribution of the drone with the FC at the center of gravity improves stability and flight control. Components such as batteries, sensors, cameras, and other payloads must be positioned evenly to achieve uniform weight distribution and maximum fit between the geometric and physical center of gravity.
7. **Battery placement:** The battery is often located in the center of the frame to ensure stability during flight. It must be ensured that the battery is rigidly mounted and secured to prevent slipping or unintentional disconnection during operation. Additionally, when properly attached, the battery acts as an inertial mass and helps dampen vibrations. Beware of landing directly on the battery since most of the batteries do have a resistant shell.
8. **Voltage monitoring:** to [dynamically scale the PIDs and maintain stable flight in low battery conditions](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/current-limiting-and-voltage-scaling.html#voltage-scaling).
9. **Current monitoring:** to compensate for the dynamic magnetic field caused by the high motor currents.
10. **FC Power supply:** Must provide enough current for the flight controller, [GNSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_navigation) receivers and other payloads operating on 5V.
11. **Roll/Pitch/Yaw-Imbalance:** When mounting the motors on the arms, especially on round arms, make sure that all motors and propellers are perfectly level so that the thrust produced is directed straight down. Misaligned motors will cause the multicopter to drift. Depending on which motors are misaligned and their direction of misalignment, the multicopter drifts laterally forward, backward, left, right, or axially around the Z-axis, and efficiency is reduced accordingly.
12. **Helical GNSS antennas:** These kinds of antennas are the [preferred choice for drones and their benefits justify the extra cost](https://discuss.ardupilot.org/t/big-gps-round-up/67755).
13. **STM32 H7 processor family:** Flight controllers that use these processors, have enough processing power and memory to run ArduCopter firmware without restrictions.

# 2. Proper initial configuration

For reproducibility and quality purposes, we configure the vehicle with a well-defined sequence of intermediate parameter files.
Each file modifies just a small set of the [over 1200 parameters on the flight controller](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/parameters.html).
By splitting the process into small manageable steps, we reduce the probability of making a mistake or missing a step and allow interleaving parameter changes with test flights.

Each intermediate parameter file is a text file, editable in any common text editor (excluding MS Word) like [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/) or [code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
It contains the *official Ardupilot parameter documentation* in the form of comments in the lines preceding the parameter.
By using this you save the time of looking up the online documentation for each parameter.

It contains the **reason why we changed the parameter** in a comment on the same line as the parameter and is used to trace each parameter change to the reason for that parameter change.
**Use it!**
You can thank me later.

Comments start with the '#' character.
A small example with a single parameter is shown below:

```text
# Arming with Rudder enable/disable
# Allow arm/disarm by rudder input. When enabled arming can be done with right rudder, disarming with left rudder.
# Rudder arming only works with throttle at zero +- deadzone (RCx_DZ). Depending on vehicle type, arming in certain
# modes is prevented. See the wiki for each vehicle. Caution is recommended when arming if it is allowed in an auto-throttle mode!
# 0: Disabled
# 1: ArmingOnly
# 2: ArmOrDisarm
ARMING_RUDDER,0 # We find it safer to use only a switch to arm instead of through rudder inputs
```

We provide you here with around 44 of these *intermediate parameter files* (*.parm).
If you are working with multiple vehicles, create a separate directory for each vehicle with a descriptive identifiable name.
Copy the 44 *intermediate parameter files* into them.
Edit the files to match the specific requirements of each vehicle.
Now you have traceable documentation records for every parameter change on each of your vehicles.

If you are in the business of manufacturing multicopters and maintain **high-quality standards that result in the production of multiple, nearly identical vehicles**, you can reuse most intermediate parameter files across these vehicles.
Only three intermediate parameter files: `03_imu_temperature_calibration_results.param`, `11_mp_setup_mandatory_hardware.param` and `23_inflight_magnetometer_fit_results.param` are specific to each vehicle instance.
All other intermediate parameter files can be used without modifications across all instances (or serial numbers) of the same product model.

Always connect the vehicle battery before connecting the USB cable (if you are using one) between the PC and the flight controller.
Always disconnect the USB cable (if you are using one) between the PC and the flight controller before disconnecting the vehicle battery.

Start by downloading the [latest Mission Planner](https://firmware.ardupilot.org/Tools/MissionPlanner/MissionPlanner-latest.msi) ground control station software for your Microsoft Windows PC and flash the latest [stable ArduCopter firmware](https://firmware.ardupilot.org/Copter/stable/) for your flight controller.
Start Mission Planner on the PC and [connect to the vehicle](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-connect-mission-planner-autopilot.html) using a USB cable.

## 2.1 Configure [IMU Temperature calibration](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-imutempcal.html) using the [offline calibration tool](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/master/Tools/scripts/tempcal_IMU.py)

For this procedure follow these steps:

1. Download the [02_imu_temperature_calibration_setup.param parameter file](diatone_taycan_mxc/params/02_imu_temperature_calibration_setup.param) to your PC, edit it with a text editor to meet your needs and in Mission Planner while connected to the flight controller [select *Compare Params*, review the changes and press *Continue* followed by *Upload Params*](https://ardupilot.org/planner/docs/mission-planner-configuration-and-tuning.html#full-parameter-list).
1. Power off the flight controller and remove the battery.
1. Place the flight controller **without battery** in a freezer capable of reaching your vehicle's minimum expected operation temperature (-18°C in our case).
1. Once the flight controller is completely cooled down to its minimum expected operation temperature, take it out and power it. **Do not move the flight controller** for one or two hours.
1. If you have a buzzer connected, you will hear a short periodic beep while the calibration is in progress. When the calibration is complete, a completion tune will play. If you have [notification LEDs](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-leds-pixhawk.html) on your flight controller they will cyclically flash red, blue and green while calibrating. If you do not have a buzzer connected nor notification LEDs, monitor the `INS_TCALn_ENABLE` parameters. On completion, the `INS_TCALn_ENABLE` parameters will change to 1 (*enable*) for each calibrated IMU.
1. Power it off, and remove the micro SDCard
1. Copy the latest `.bin` log file in the micro SDcard from `/APM/LOGS` to your PC
1. Insert the micro SDcard back into the flight controller
1. Then use the [Offline Calibration Tool](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-imutempcal.html#offline-calibration-tool) to calculate the value of the temperature calibration parameters.
   1. Download the [tempcal_IMU.py](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/blob/master/Tools/scripts/tempcal_IMU.py) python script to your PC.
   2. Execute `python tempcal_IMU.py <your_bin_log_file.bin>`
   3. the generated `tcal.parm` file should be similar to the [03_imu_temperature_calibration_results.param parameter file](diatone_taycan_mxc/params/03_imu_temperature_calibration_results.param).
   4. Upload the tool-generated `tcal.parm` file (not ours) to your flight controller.

The graphic below depicts the accelerometer drift versus time and the board temperature versus time.
The temperature curve, depicted in black, is logarithmic as expected.
The other curves are smooth, proving that the flight controller was not moved in the process and the calibration is valid.
As can be seen, before the calibration temperature changes caused a big change in accelerometer/gyro drift.
After the calibration, temperature changes will cause no significant accelerometer/gyro drift changes.

![MatekH743Slim IMU temperature calibration](matekh743slim_accel.png)

## 2.2 Completely assemble the vehicle

**The vehicle must be completely assembled, with all cables connected, but WITHOUT propellers attached**.


## 2.3 Configure flight controller orientation

Follow [mounting the autopilot](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-mounting-the-flight-controller.html) documentation to determine the correct value of the [AHRS_ORIENTATION](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/parameters.html#ahrs-orientation) parameter.
For its configuration, we created a [04_board_orientation.param parameter file](diatone_taycan_mxc/params/04_board_orientation.param). Download it to your PC, edit it with a text editor and in Mission Planner while connected to the vehicle [select *Compare Params*, review the changes and press *Continue* followed by *Upload Params*](https://ardupilot.org/planner/docs/mission-planner-configuration-and-tuning.html#full-parameter-list).

## 2.4 Configure the RC receiver

In our setup, we use EdgeTX firmware on the RC transmitter.
Download and install *EdgeTX Companion* to your PC.
Start it and configure it as depicted below.

![EdgeTX companion setup](EdgeTXCompanion_setup.png)

After that, use a micro SDcard to update the firmware on the Radiomaster TX16S and copy the **yaapu** scripts to the `/WIDGETS/yaapu` directory on the micro SDcard.
Once the RC transmitter is running EdgeTx you can load the [Taycan MX-C EdgeTX configuration file](TaycanMX-C.etx) into EdgeTX companion and upload it to the radio.
Or simply copy only the settings that you require, EdgeTX companion is very flexible.

In our setup, we used an advanced RC receiver that cannot be fully configured using Mission Planner's `SETUP >> Mandatory Hardware >> Radio Calibration` menu.
For its configuration, we created a [05_remote_controller.param parameter file](diatone_taycan_mxc/params/05_remote_controller.param). Download it to your PC, edit it with a text editor and in Mission Planner while connected to the vehicle [select *Compare Params*, review the changes and press *Continue* followed by *Upload Params*](https://ardupilot.org/planner/docs/mission-planner-configuration-and-tuning.html#full-parameter-list).

## 2.5 Configure telemetry

The RC transmitter we used has a big color display where telemetry data is displayed, nevertheless, we use telemetry data for real-time flight monitoring with Mission Planner or QGroundControl.
For its configuration, we created a [06_telemetry.param parameter file](diatone_taycan_mxc/params/06_telemetry.param). Download it to your PC, edit it with a text editor and in Mission Planner while connected to the vehicle [select *Compare Params*, review the changes and press *Continue* followed by *Upload Params*](https://ardupilot.org/planner/docs/mission-planner-configuration-and-tuning.html#full-parameter-list).
Once this is operating we no longer need the USB connection to the vehicle.

## 2.6 Configure the ESC

In our setup, we used a [Bi-directional Dshot ESC](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-dshot-escs.html) that cannot be fully configured using Mission Planner's `SETUP >> Mandatory Hardware >> Servo Output` menu.
For its configuration, we created a [07_esc.param parameter file](diatone_taycan_mxc/params/07_esc.param). Download it to your PC, edit it with a text editor and in Mission Planner while connected to the vehicle [select *Compare Params*, review the changes and press *Continue* followed by *Upload Params*](https://ardupilot.org/planner/docs/mission-planner-configuration-and-tuning.html#full-parameter-list).

The step above configured ESC communication pass-thru.
In our vehicle, we use *BLHeli_32 ARM* ESC firmware.
So we use BLHeliSuite32 Version 32.9.0.6 to configure the ESCs.
Flash the Firmware version described in the table above.
Configure the parameters to match the figures below.

![ESC Setup](BLHeli32_Konfig.PNG)

![ESC Overview](BLHeli32_Konfig2.PNG)

## 2.7 Configure the primary battery monitor

In our setup, the battery voltage is measured directly at the flight controller `Vbat` pin and the current is measured at the 4-in1 ESC `Curr` pin.
For its configuration, we created a [08_batt1.param parameter file](diatone_taycan_mxc/params/08_batt1.param). Download it to your PC, edit it with a text editor and in Mission Planner while connected to the vehicle [select *Compare Params*, review the changes and press *Continue* followed by *Upload Params*](https://ardupilot.org/planner/docs/mission-planner-configuration-and-tuning.html#full-parameter-list).

## 2.8 Configure the redundant (secondary) battery monitor

To be on the safe side we used a Holybro PM02 as a redundant secondary voltage and current monitor.
One other option would be the [CBU 2-8s DroneCAN Battery Monitor and Current Sensor](https://www.cbunmanned.com/store).
For its configuration, we created a [09_batt2.param parameter file](diatone_taycan_mxc/params/09_batt2.param). Download it to your PC, edit it with a text editor and in Mission Planner while connected to the vehicle [select *Compare Params*, review the changes and press *Continue* followed by *Upload Params*](https://ardupilot.org/planner/docs/mission-planner-configuration-and-tuning.html#full-parameter-list).

## 2.9 Configure the GNSS receiver(s)

GNSS receivers very often contain a magnetometer (compass) sensor.
So they need to be configured before proceeding to the next step.
For its configuration, we created a [10_gnss.param parameter file](diatone_taycan_mxc/params/10_gnss.param). Download it to your PC, edit it with a text editor and in Mission Planner while connected to the vehicle [select *Compare Params*, review the changes and press *Continue* followed by *Upload Params*](https://ardupilot.org/planner/docs/mission-planner-configuration-and-tuning.html#full-parameter-list).

## 2.10 Configure "Mandatory Hardware" Parameters

On Mission Planner select `SETUP >> Mandatory Hardware` and work yourself through all the submenus as described below. **DO NOT SKIP ANY STEP**.

### [Frame Type](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/frame-type-configuration.html)

This relates to the `FRAME_CLASS` and `FRAME_TYPE` parameters.

### [Initial Tune Parameters](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/setting-up-for-tuning.html)

Answer the questions that Mission Planner asks, select *Add suggested settings for 4.0 and up (Battery failsafe and Fence)* and upload the calculated parameters to the flight controller by pressing `Upload to FC`.

![MP Initial Tune Parameters questions](mp_initial_parameters.png)

![MP Initial Tune Parameters results](mp_initial_parameters_calc.png)

### [Accel Calibration](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-accelerometer-calibration.html)

Follow the [ArduPilot wiki instructions](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-accelerometer-calibration.html) and calibrate the accelerometers.
For small vehicles use:

- *Calibrate Accel*
- *Calibrate level*

For very large vehicles:

- *Simple Accel Cal*

### [Compass](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-compass-calibration-in-mission-planner.html)

Follow the [ArduPilot wiki instructions](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-compass-calibration-in-mission-planner.html) and calibrate the compass(es).

Disable internal compasses if the battery or power wires are close to the flight controller.

Do not select *Automatically learn offsets* it makes little sense on a multicopter.
And we will do in-flight MagFit later

If you have a large vehicle you might want to use [large vehicle MagCal](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-compass-calibration-in-mission-planner.html#large-vehicle-magcal) instead.

### [Radio Calibration](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-radio-control-calibration.html)

Follow the [ArduPilot wiki instructions](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-radio-control-calibration.html) and calibrate the Remote Control.

Turn on your RC Transmitter and move the sticks around.
Make sure all transmitter channels move across their entire range.

### [Servo Output](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-dshot-escs.html#configure-the-servo-functions)

Change the parameters according to your requirements.

### [ESC Calibration](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/esc-calibration.html)

Do not make changes here, these parameters will be set later on the [Motor/Propeller order and direction test](#214-motorpropeller-order-and-direction-test) section

### [Flight Modes](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/flight-modes.html)

Define the flight modes you plan to use.
Do not use [`POSHOLD`](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/poshold-mode.html), use [`LOITER`](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/loiter-mode.html) instead.
Both only work outdoors because they require a good GNSS signal quality with low variance.
If that is not possible, [GPS glitches](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-diagnosing-problems-using-logs.html#gps-glitches) will occur and [`ALTHOLD` flight mode](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/altholdmode.html) is recommended instead.

### [Failsafe](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/failsafe-landing-page.html)

These are very important and can save your vehicle in case of failure.
Configure at least [`Radio Failsafe`](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/radio-failsafe.html), [`Battery Failsafe`](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/failsafe-battery.html) and [`Geofence`](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-ac2_simple_geofence.html)

### HW ID

This is just informational. No need to change anything.

### [ADSB](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-ads-b-receiver.html)

Change the parameters according to your requirements.

### Last step

The changes you did in the steps above have been stored in your vehicle.
Most of the changed parameters are vehicle-instance specific and can not be reused between two vehicles, no matter how similar they are.
We provide an [11_mp_setup_mandatory_hardware.param parameter file](diatone_taycan_mxc/params/11_mp_setup_mandatory_hardware.param) only for illustrative purposes.
You must not upload our vehicle-specific file to your vehicle.

Most people wrongly assume that they are now done with tuning.
But that is wrong, **there are still steps to do before the first flight**.

## 2.11 General configuration

The next configuration steps are exclusively done by editing intermediate parameter configuration files and in Mission Planner while connected to the vehicle [selecting *Compare Params*, reviewing the changes and pressing *Continue* followed by *Upload Params*](https://ardupilot.org/planner/docs/mission-planner-configuration-and-tuning.html#full-parameter-list).

In our case, a 3'' small drone, the props are expected to rotate at speeds higher than 400Hz and we have an STM32 H7 family processor.
So the scheduler loop rate should be increased to 800Hz.
For the inflight MagFit step, we must activate [Lua scripting](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-lua-scripts.html).

Download the [12_general_configuration.param parameter file](diatone_taycan_mxc/params/12_general_configuration.param) to your PC, edit it with a text editor to meet your needs and in Mission Planner while connected to the vehicle [select *Compare Params*, review the changes and press *Continue* followed by *Upload Params*](https://ardupilot.org/planner/docs/mission-planner-configuration-and-tuning.html#full-parameter-list).

## 2.12 ArduPilot Hardware Report

For this test, you need to:

1. Visit the [ArduPilot Hardware report](https://firmware.ardupilot.org/Tools/WebTools/HardwareReport/) on your PC and upload the `.bin` file you got in the previous section.
1. Take a look at the results

It should look like the following picture.
If it doesn't, go back and perform the missing calibration(s).

## 2.13 Configure Logging

![MP LOG_BITMASK parameter](mp_logging_bitmask.png)

Download the [13_logging.param parameter file](diatone_taycan_mxc/params/13_logging.param) to your PC, edit it with a text editor to meet your needs and in Mission Planner while connected to the vehicle [select *Compare Params*, review the changes and press *Continue* followed by *Upload Params*](https://ardupilot.org/planner/docs/mission-planner-configuration-and-tuning.html#full-parameter-list).

## 2.14 Motor/Propeller order and direction test

Start by [checking the motor numbering with the Mission Planner Motor test](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/connect-escs-and-motors.html#checking-the-motor-numbering-with-the-mission-planner-motor-test) without propellers. Remember the **correct order is A, B, C, D** and not 1, 2, 3, 4.

Make sure the `MOT_SPIN_ARM` is high enough so that all motors spin reliably.
Make sure the `MOT_SPIN_MIN` is at least 0.03 higher than `MOT_SPIN_ARM`.

**!!! If you get this test wrong or skip it, you might destroy your vehicle and endanger yourself !!!**

Do not try to test the attitude controller without propellers, it will not work, such tests are inconclusive and meaningless.
Do not try to test the attitude controller with the vehicle tied down on the ground, it will not work, such tests are inconclusive and meaningless.
At this point, the vehicle does not react to roll, pitch, yaw or thrust inputs.

Now mount the propellers on the vehicle.

After that, follow the [setting Motor Range](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/set-motor-range.html) to adjust the motor demand by the flight controller to the limitations of the ESC.

### [Motor Thrust scaling](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/motor-thrust-scaling.html) ([MOT_THST_EXPO](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/parameters.html#mot-thst-expo), [MOT_SPIN_MIN](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/parameters.html#mot-spin-min) and [MOT_SPIN_MAX](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/parameters.html#mot-spin-max))

These three parameters linearize (correct) the non-linear *thrust vs. PWM* response of the propulsion system (battery, ESC, motors, propellers).
They are **crucial** for the stability of the vehicle.
If this is set too high we see an increase in gain at the lower end of the thrust range and a decrease in gain at the upper end.
**Therefore when set to high you can see instability at low throttle and if set too low you can see instability at high throttle.**

The automation on `SETUP >> Mandatory Hardware >> Initial Tune Parameters` gave you a good starting point on their values.
But we recommend using a [Trust Stand](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/motor-thrust-scaling.html#thrust-stands) or [Olliw method](http://www.olliw.eu/2018/thrust-from-motor-data/) or [ArduPilot DIY Thrust Stand](https://discuss.ardupilot.org/t/ardupilot-thrust-stand/68352) to determine their value.
At the time of writing [Automatic `MOT_THST_EXPO` estimation lua script](https://discuss.ardupilot.org/t/automatic-mot-thst-expo-estimation-lua-script/100704/) is not yet ready for production use.


## 2.15 Optional PID adjustment

If you have a very small, or a very large vehicle that requires non-default PID values for a safe flight, change them in the [15_pid_adjustment.param parameter file](diatone_taycan_mxc/params/15_pid_adjustment.param)
Usually, smaller vehicles require lower than default PID rate values.
Larger vehicles usually require higher than default PID rate values.

## 2.16 Remote ID (aka Drone ID)

Read and follow [ArduPilot's Remote ID setup instructions](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-remoteid.html).
You might have to [build OpenDroneID firmware for production](https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/opendroneid.html).
Edit the `16_remote_id.param` file with a text editor to meet your needs and in Mission Planner while connected to the vehicle [select *Compare Params*, review the changes and press *Continue* followed by *Upload Params*](https://ardupilot.org/planner/docs/mission-planner-configuration-and-tuning.html#full-parameter-list).

## 2.17 Notch filters setup

Configure the gyro noise reduction notch filters with a estimation of the operation parameters as described on the [17_notch_filter_setup.param parameter file](diatone_taycan_mxc/params/17_notch_filter_setup.param).
Edit it with a text editor to meet your needs and in Mission Planner while connected to the vehicle [select *Compare Params*, review the changes and press *Continue* followed by *Upload Params*](https://ardupilot.org/planner/docs/mission-planner-configuration-and-tuning.html#full-parameter-list).
The estimation will be improved after the first flight.


# 3. First flight: Motor Thrust Hover and Harmonic Notch data collection

For more detailed information visit the [First flight](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/flying-arducopter.html)

Test the initial setup on the ground in [stabilize flight mode](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/stabilize-mode.html) by using as little RC transmitter throttle as possible without taking off.
At this sweet spot, inspect all axes (roll, pitch and yaw) by providing small RC transmitter stick inputs.
If the multicopter behaves correspondingly, the setup is good to go.

After some careful test maneuvers switch to `ALTHOLD` and hover for 30 to 40 seconds one to two meters above the ground. Land and disarm.

Immediately check for hot motors.
If the motors are too hot, check the `.bin` dataflash log, high or oscillating `RATE.*out` values indicate which PID gain you should reduce to remove the output oscillations causing the motors to heat up.

## 3.1 [Notch filter calibration](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-imu-notch-filtering.html)

Load the `.bin` log from the first flight onto the [online Ardupilot Filter Review tool](https://firmware.ardupilot.org/Tools/WebTools/FilterReview/)
Follow the [instructions from Peter Hall on his Blog Post](https://discuss.ardupilot.org/t/new-fft-filter-setup-and-review-web-tool/102572) to configure the Harmonic Notch filter(s).

The graph below is a bode diagram of the gyro signals before and after the low-pass and Harmonic Notch filters.
As you can see, the filters remove most of the vibration noise from the gyro sensors.

![Filter IMU1](filter_imu.png)

Below is the configuration we used.

![Filter Configuration](filter_konfiguration.png)

In our case, we got the [18_notch_filter_results.param parameter file](diatone_taycan_mxc/params/18_notch_filter_results.param). Edit it with a text editor to meet your needs and in Mission Planner while connected to the vehicle [select *Compare Params*, review the changes and press *Continue* followed by *Upload Params*](https://ardupilot.org/planner/docs/mission-planner-configuration-and-tuning.html#full-parameter-list).

Load the `.bin` log from the first flight onto the [online Ardupilot Log Viewer](https://plotbeta.ardupilot.org/) or into Mission Planner.
Take a look at the `VIBE.VibeX`, `VIBE.VibeY`, `VIBE.VibeZ` graphs they [all should be below 15](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-measuring-vibration.html)

According to common ArduPilot forum knowledge, and quoting @xfacta:

- Vibrations over 30 are very bad
- Vibrations over 20 are causing issues even if you don't know it yet
- Vibrations over 15 are in a grey area - it could go either way - check clipping, it must be zero
- Vibrations below 10 are good

Now upload the `.bin` log to the [Hardware-Report Tool](https://firmware.ardupilot.org/Tools/WebTools/HardwareReport/) once again to check CPU load and loop times, which in our case look like this:

![Hardware-Report CPU load](hardware_report_cpu_load.png)
![Hardware-Report CPU loop times](hardware_report_loop_times.png)

## 3.2 Configure the throttle controller

Use the `.bin` log from the first flight to set the parameters described on the `19_throttle_controller.param` file. Edit it with a text editor to meet your needs and in Mission Planner while connected to the vehicle [select *Compare Params*, review the changes and press *Continue* followed by *Upload Params*](https://ardupilot.org/planner/docs/mission-planner-configuration-and-tuning.html#full-parameter-list).

# 4. Second flight: MagFit

Now that the Harmonic Notch filter and the throttle controller are configured, the second flight will be safer.
This flight will be used to calibrate the compass during a realistic operation scenario in the air.

## [Inflight MagFit calibration](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-magfit.html#using-mavexplorer-s-integrated-magfit-utility)

Follow these steps:

1. Download the `copter-magfit-helper.lua` and `advance-wp.lua` scripts from [Scripted MagFit flightpath generation](https://discuss.ardupilot.org/t/scripted-magfit-flightpath-generation/97536) and put them on the micro SDCard's `APM/scripts` folder
1. Activate MagFit by downloading the [22_inflight_magnetometer_fit_setup.param parameter file](diatone_taycan_mxc/params/22_inflight_magnetometer_fit_setup.param) to your PC, edit it with a text editor to meet your needs and in Mission Planner while connected to the vehicle [select *Compare Params*, review the changes and press *Continue* followed by *Uploadd Params*](https://ardupilot.org/planner/docs/mission-planner-configuration-and-tuning.html#full-parameter-list)
1. Perform the MagFit figure-eight flight and land
1. Download the latest `.bin` dataflash log file from the micro SDcard's `/APM/LOGS` folder
1. Load it into MAVExplorer using the command line: `MAVExplorer.py filename.bin` or into the [ArduPilot MAGFit in flight compass calibration](https://firmware.ardupilot.org/Tools/WebTools/MAGFit/) using an internet browser.
1. Select the area where the multicopter performed the Figure eight (exclude the takeoff and landing flight sections)
1. Perform the MagFit calculations. In our case, we got the [23_inflight_magnetometer_fit_results.param parameter file](diatone_taycan_mxc/params/23_inflight_magnetometer_fit_results.param)
1. Upload the tool-generated `.param` file, not ours, to the vehicle.

![MagFit results](magfit_1.png)

After that repeat the steps described in [2.12 ArduPilot Hardware Report](#212-ardupilot-hardware-report).
The report should now look like this:

![Hardware-Report after MagFit](hardware_report_magfit.png)


# 5. Third flight: Evaluate the aircraft tune - part 1

Follow the first part of [evaluating the aircraft tune](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/evaluating-the-aircraft-tune.html#evaluating-the-aircraft-tune).

After landing take a look at the `RATE.*out` values in the `.bin` log file, they all should be below 0.1.

Download the [26_evaluate_the_aircraft_tune_ff_disable.param parameter file](diatone_taycan_mxc/params/26_evaluate_the_aircraft_tune_ff_disable.param), and in Mission Planner while connected to the vehicle [select *Compare Params*, review the changes and press *Continue* followed by *Upload Params*](https://ardupilot.org/planner/docs/mission-planner-configuration-and-tuning.html#full-parameter-list).


# 6. Fourth flight: Evaluate the aircraft tune - part 2

Follow the second part of [evaluating the aircraft tune](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/evaluating-the-aircraft-tune.html#evaluating-the-aircraft-tune).

After landing take a look at the `RATE.*out` values in the `.bin` log file, they all should be below 0.1.

Download the [27_evaluate_the_aircraft_tune_ff_enable.param parameter file](diatone_taycan_mxc/params/27_evaluate_the_aircraft_tune_ff_enable.param), and in Mission Planner while connected to the vehicle [select *Compare Params*, review the changes and press *Continue* followed by *Upload Params*](https://ardupilot.org/planner/docs/mission-planner-configuration-and-tuning.html#full-parameter-list).


# 7. [Autotune flight(s)](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/autotune.html)

The Autotune is an automated iterative process:

1. It changes the parameter values of the attitude PID controllers
1. Tests the [overshoot and settling-time](https://aleksandarhaber.com/transient-response-specifications-peak-time-settling-time-rise-time-and-percent-overshoot/) of the control loop using the new PID values
1. If they are within the desired requirements, the process is over. If not, it gets repeated from the beginning

If the battery gets depleted before you can complete the Autotune flight(s), download the latest `.bin` log file from the micro SDCard directory `/APM/LOGS`.
Take a look at the `ATUN` messages.
They show how the PID values change over time.
You should use the latest PID values from the `ATUN` messages to set the starting point of your next PID Autotune with a fresh battery.
But be careful, **these new PID values might be unstable and cause your vehicle to crash**.
To be on the safe side perform the third and fourth flights again according to the instructions above.
This way, the Autotune will restart from the partially optimal values it found before the battery got depleted, instead of starting from scratch.

An example of the relevant `ATUN` message data of an interrupted yaw Autotune `.bin` dataflash log is depicted below:

![interrupted yaw Autotune ATUN messages](mp_autotune_yaw1.png)

The correspondence between the PIDs' initial values and the `ATUN` message fields is shown in the respective tables for each of the four Autotune axes in the sections below.

The tune of the vehicle must be done in the vehicle's most agile configuration.
That is, the vehicle will be at its minimum take-off weight with fully charged batteries.

This is why we will do Autotune with multiple flights, one axis per flight.

Typically the [quality of the Autotune results for each axis is proportional to the value](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sCskKQIdeg) of the `ATC_ANG_RLL_P`, `ATC_ANG_PIT_P`, and `ATC_ANG_YAW_P` parameters for their respective axis.
Also the higher the values, the tighter the tune.
If you get low values, improve the hardware and revisit the previous sections to further reduce the vibrations.

Autotuning in low-wind conditions is desirable, but if that is not possible you can increase the `AUTOTUNE_AGGR` parameter value to 0.110 or even 0.120.
That is a workaround and will not produce as good results as low-wind conditions autotune.

We set up the autotune as a flight mode, and as such it will use the underlying `ALTHOLD` flight mode.
If you want to use the `LOITER` flight mode as the underlying mode during autotune you need to [set an RC channel function switch to autotune](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/autotune.html#setup-before-flying-in-autotune-mode).

## Roll axis

1. Download the [28_autotune_roll_setup.param parameter file](diatone_taycan_mxc/params/28_autotune_roll_setup.param) to your PC and upload it to the flight controller.
   It will activate the roll axis Autotune.
1. Outdoors on a non-windy day (or indoors in a big warehouse like we at IAV do) take off and fly in either [`AltHold`](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/altholdmode.html) or `Loiter` flight mode.
1. At about 2 meters high, select `Autotune` flight mode in the RC transmitter to engage Autotune.
1. Use the RC transmitter sticks to correct the vehicle position if it gets too high, too low or too close to obstacles.
1. Once the Autotune is completed, land and disarm the vehicle without changing the flight mode.

You should get something like the [29_autotune_roll_results.param parameter file](diatone_taycan_mxc/params/29_autotune_roll_results.param)

The autotune might have found a poor solution, here are some indicators of a poor tune:

1. The resulting `ATC_ANG_RLL_P` parameter value is smaller than 4.5
1. The resulting `ATC_RAT_RLL_D` parameter value is equal to the `AUTOTUNE_MIN_D` parameter value

If the battery got depleted before Autotune completion, change the initial PID parameters as shown in the table below:

|PID parameter name|PID parameter value based on the ATUN field|
|:-|:-|
|-|ATUN.Axis=0|
|ATC_RAT_RLL_P|ATUN.RP|
|ATC_RAT_RLL_I|ATUN.RP|
|ATC_RAT_RLL_D|ATUN.RD|
|ATC_ANG_RLL_P|ATUN.SP|
|ATC_ACCEL_R_MAX|ATUN.ddt|

## Pitch axis

1. Download the [30_autotune_pitch_setup.param parameter file](diatone_taycan_mxc/params/30_autotune_pitch_setup.param) to your PC and upload it to the flight controller.
   It will activate the pitch axis Autotune.
1. Outdoors on a non-windy day (or indoors in a big warehouse like we at IAV do) take off and fly in either `AltHold` or `Loiter` flight mode.
1. At about 2 meters high, select `Autotune` flight mode in the RC Transmitter to engage Autotune.
1. Use the RC transmitter sticks to correct the vehicle position if it gets too high, too low or too close to obstacles.
1. Once the autotune is completed, land and disarm the vehicle without changing the flight mode.

You should get something like the [31_autotune_pitch_results.param parameter file](diatone_taycan_mxc/params/31_autotune_pitch_results.param)

The autotune might have found a poor solution, here are some indicators of a poor tune:

1. The resulting `ATC_ANG_PIT_P` parameter value is smaller than 4.5
1. The resulting `ATC_RAT_PIT_D` parameter value is equal to the `AUTOTUNE_MIN_D` parameter value

If the battery got depleted before Autotune completion, change the initial PID parameters as shown in the table below:

|PID parameter name|PID parameter value based on the ATUN field|
|:-|:-|
|-|ATUN.Axis=1|
|ATC_RAT_PIT_P|ATUN.RP|
|ATC_RAT_PIT_I|ATUN.RP|
|ATC_RAT_PIT_D|ATUN.RD|
|ATC_ANG_PIT_P|ATUN.SP|
|ATC_ACCEL_P_MAX|ATUN.ddt|

## Yaw axis

1. Download the [32_autotune_yaw_setup.param parameter file](diatone_taycan_mxc/params/32_autotune_yaw_setup.param) to your PC and upload it to the flight controller.
   It will activate the yaw axis Autotune.
1. Outdoors on a non-windy day (or indoors in a big warehouse like we at IAV do) take off and fly in either `AltHold` or `Loiter` flight mode.
1. At about 2 meters high, select `Autotune` flight mode in the RC transmitter to engage Autotune.
1. Use the RC transmitter sticks to correct the vehicle position if it gets too high, too low, or too close to obstacles.
1. Once the Autotune is completed, land and disarm the vehicle without changing the flight mode.

You should get something like the [33_autotune_yaw_results.param parameter file](diatone_taycan_mxc/params/33_autotune_yaw_results.param)

The autotune might have found a poor solution, here are some indicators of a poor tune:

1. The resulting `ATC_ANG_YAW_P` parameter value is smaller than 4.5

If the battery got depleted before Autotune completion, change the initial PID parameters as shown in the table below:

|PID parameter name|PID parameter value based on the ATUN field|
|:-|:-|
|-|ATUN.Axis=2|
|ATC_RAT_YAW_P|ATUN.RP|
|ATC_RAT_YAW_I|**ATUN.RP * 0.1**|
|**ATC_RAT_YAW_FLTE**|ATUN.RD|
|ATC_ANG_YAW_P|ATUN.SP|
|ATC_ACCEL_Y_MAX|ATUN.ddt|

## [Yaw D axis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b76bPEeRCEk&t=963s)

This particular Autotune axis is only relevant for small, agile vehicles.

1. Download the [34_autotune_yawd_setup.param parameter file](diatone_taycan_mxc/params/34_autotune_yawd_setup.param) to your PC and upload it to the flight controller.
   It will activate the yaw D axis Autotune.
1. Outdoors on a non-windy day (or indoors in a big warehouse like we at IAV do) take-off and fly in either `AltHold` or `Loiter` flight mode.
1. At about 2 meters high, select `Autotune` flight mode in the RC transmitter to engage Autotune.
1. Use the RC transmitter sticks to correct the vehicle position if it gets too high, too low or too close to obstacles.
1. Once the Autotune is completed, land and disarm the vehicle without changing the flight mode.

You should get something like the [35_autotune_yawd_results.param parameter file](diatone_taycan_mxc/params/35_autotune_yawd_results.param)

Make sure that your resulting `ATC_RAT_YAW_D` parameter value is different from `AUTOTUNE_MIN_D` value.
If that is not the case then the autotune failed to find a proper `ATC_RAT_YAW_D`.
The cause is probably too high noise values at the input of the Yaw D controller.

If the battery got depleted before Autotune completion, change the initial PID parameters as shown in the table below:

|PID parameter name|PID parameter value based on the ATUN field|
|:-|:-|
|-|ATUN.Axis=3|
|ATC_RAT_YAW_P|ATUN.RP|
|ATC_RAT_YAW_I|**ATUN.RP * 0.1**|
|ATC_RAT_YAW_D|ATUN.RD|
|ATC_ANG_YAW_P|ATUN.SP|
|ATC_ACCEL_Y_MAX|ATUN.ddt|

## [re-tune the roll and pitch axis](https://youtu.be/jK0I97dMsK0?si=F1lyl2iq8gUUencl&t=2535)

Now that the yaw axis is tuned, the [autotune should be able to improve the roll and pitch axis tune](https://youtu.be/jK0I97dMsK0?si=F1lyl2iq8gUUencl&t=2535).

1. Download the [36_autotune_roll_pitch_retune_setup.param parameter file](diatone_taycan_mxc/params/36_autotune_roll_pitch_retune_setup.param) to your PC and upload it to the flight controller.
   It will activate the roll and pitch axis Autotune.
1. Outdoors on a non-windy day (or indoors in a big warehouse like we at IAV do) take off and fly in either `AltHold` or `Loiter` flight mode.
1. At about 2 meters high, select `Autotune` flight mode in the RC transmitter to engage Autotune.
1. Use the RC transmitter sticks to correct the vehicle position if it gets too high, too low or too close to obstacles.
1. Once the Autotune is completed, land and disarm the vehicle without changing the flight mode.

You should get something like the [37_autotune_roll_pitch_retune_results.param parameter file](diatone_taycan_mxc/params/37_autotune_roll_pitch_retune_results.param)


# 8. Performance evaluation flight

As you can see in the picture below, the Stabilize Roll, Pitch and Yaw P gains achieved with this method are high.
The maximum *stabilize P gain* that autotune strives for is 36, and that was achieved in the roll axis!
This is a clear indication that the vibration noise filters and the PID control loops are working well together.

![Mission Planner's `Extended Tuning` screenshot with our autotune results](mp_extended_tunning_results_after_autotune.png)

After using Autotune to find proper PID parameters, it is time to evaluate the performance of the vehicle's control loops in real flight.

Follow these steps:

1. Power on the vehicle
1. Download the [26_evaluate_the_aircraft_tune_ff_disable.param parameter file](diatone_taycan_mxc/params/26_evaluate_the_aircraft_tune_ff_disable.param), and in Mission Planner while connected to the vehicle [select *Compare Params*, review the changes and press *Continue* followed by *Upload Params*](https://ardupilot.org/planner/docs/mission-planner-configuration-and-tuning.html#full-parameter-list).
1. Switch to `ALTHOLD` flight mode and wait for home location acquisition.
1. Take-off at around 10m above the ground.
1. Perform smooth maneuvers using the RC transmitter roll stick.
1. Perform smooth maneuvers using the RC transmitter pitch stick.
1. Perform smooth maneuvers using the RC transmitter yaw stick.
1. Repeat the maneuvers with increasing aggressivity making sure you stay inside the stable envelope of the vehicle.
1. Land and download the latest `.bin` log file from `/APM/LOGS` to your PC
1. Use [ArduPilot's PID Review Tool](https://firmware.ardupilot.org/Tools/WebTools/PIDReview/) to review the PID step response of each PID.
1. Download the [27_evaluate_the_aircraft_tune_ff_enable.param parameter file](diatone_taycan_mxc/params/27_evaluate_the_aircraft_tune_ff_enable.param), and in Mission Planner while connected to the vehicle [select *Compare Params*, review the changes and press *Continue* followed by *Upload Params*](https://ardupilot.org/planner/docs/mission-planner-configuration-and-tuning.html#full-parameter-list).

In our vehicle, we got a transient response of around 60ms in roll and pitch and around 110ms in yaw.

Step response Roll:

![Step response Roll](pid_review_step_response_roll.png)

Step response Pitch:

![Step response Pitch](pid_review_step_response_pitch.png)

Step response Yaw:

![Step response Yaw](pid_review_step_response_yaw.png)

If you are satisfied with the performance, increase `ATC_THR_MIX_MAX` to 0.9 (default is 0.5) to increase prioritization of attitude control over throttle.
This can reduce the pitch overshoot sometimes seen (especially on copters with large propellers) in AltHold if the vehicle suddenly slows after performing a fast-forward flight.

Take a look at the `RATE.*out` values in the `.bin` log file, they all should be below 0.1.


# 9. [Windspeed Estimation flight(s)](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/airspeed-estimation.html)

Follow [ArduCopter's airspeed estimation Wiki](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/airspeed-estimation.html) and/or use the [Lua script provided by Yuri in the forum](https://discuss.ardupilot.org/t/scripting-copter-wind-estimation-baro-compensation-tuning/98470/).

In our case, the frontal area looks like this:
![frontal area of our drone](frontal_area_cropped.png)
and the side area looks like this:
![side area of our drone](side_area_cropped.png)

Divided by 1,000,000 to convert from mm² to m², the frontal area is 0.01097 m² and the side area is 0.01455 m².
The weight of our drone is 560g, therefore the ballistic coefficients are

- [EK3_DRAG_BCOEF_X](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/parameters.html#ek3-drag-bcoef-x) = 0.56 kg / 0.01097 m² = 51.0399
- [EK3_DRAG_BCOEF_Y](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/parameters.html#ek3-drag-bcoef-y) = 0.56 kg / 0.01455 m² = 38.4798

Download the [38_windspeed_estimation.param parameter file](diatone_taycan_mxc/params/38_windspeed_estimation.param) to your PC, edit it with a text editor to meet your needs and in Mission Planner while connected to the vehicle [select *Compare Params*, review the changes and press *Continue* followed by *Upload Params*](https://ardupilot.org/planner/docs/mission-planner-configuration-and-tuning.html#full-parameter-list).

Now do the flight to collect the data to [Calculate the Propeller Drag Coefficient](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/airspeed-estimation.html#calculate-the-propeller-drag-coefficient).
After that, open the logs with MAVExplorer to get the needed values.
Display the absolute values for acceleration in X and Y, as well as GPS speed by inputting `graph abs(IMU.AccX) abs(IMU.AccY) GPS.Spd`.
Then crop it so you only see the tests in AltHold flight mode.
It should look like this:

![Wind estimation Weathervaning](MAVExplorer_Windestimation_weathervaning_abs.png)

Note that our test flight was quite noisy but there *is* enough data to extract.
Next crop it so you see one acceleration into the wind and the consecutive deceleration.
It should look like this:

![Wind estimation rightside](MAVExplorer_Windestimation_right.png)

Get the current wind speed, that is the GPS speed when AccY reaches zero and the GPS speed has stabilized.
In this case, it is:

- windspeed = 2.35 [m/s]

Next, get the groundspeed at the start of the test.
That is the GPS speed when the vehicle starts to decelerate after the little bit of jitter is over.
In this case, it is:

- groundspeed = 3.9 [m/s]

With this information, you can calculate the vehicle's airspeed, which is:

- airspeed = windspeed + groundspeed = 6.25 [m/s]

Next get the maximum acceleration during the test, which is the acceleration at the time of the groundspeed measurement.
In this case, it is:

- max_accel = 4.2 [m/s²]

With the air density at the time of testing and the previously calculated ballistic drag coefficient (`EK3_DRAG_BCOEF_X` for front and back, `EK3_DRAG_BCOEF_Y` for left and right side) you can now calculate the bluff body drag, which is 1/2 * air density * airspeed^2 / BCOEF.
In this case, it is:

- Bluff body drag = 0.5 * 1.260 [kg/m³] * (6.25 [m/s])² / 38.4798 [kg/m²] = 0.6395 [m/s²]

With that, you can now calculate the momentum drag, which is max_accel - bluff body drag.
In this case, it is:

- Momentum drag = 4.2 [m/s²] - 0.6395 [m/s²] = 3.5605 [m/s²]

Now you can calculate the momentum drag coefficient `EK3_DRAG_MCOEF`, which is momentum drag / airspeed.
In this case, it is:

- [EK3_DRAG_MCOEF](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/parameters.html#ek3-drag-mcoef) = 3.5605 [m/s²] / 6.25 [m/s] = 0.5697 [1/s]

For better accuracy, you should do that for all directions and take the average. In our case, we got:

- front: 0.4628 [1/s]
- back: 0.4757 [1/s]
- left: 0.5426 [1/s]
- right: 0.5697 [1/s]
- average: 0.5127 [1/s]

Note that these are quite high values due to the ducts around the props.
For a normal copter with open propellers, it should be in the range of 0.1 to 0.2.

After it is set, do another flight and [check that the windspeed and direction are correctly estimated](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/airspeed-estimation.html#viewing-windspeed-and-direction-in-real-time).


# 10. [Baro Compensation flight(s)](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/airspeed-estimation.html#barometer-position-error-compensation)

Follow [ArduCopter's baro compensation Wiki](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/airspeed-estimation.html#barometer-position-error-compensation) and/or use the [Lua script provided by Yuri in the forum](https://discuss.ardupilot.org/t/scripting-copter-wind-estimation-baro-compensation-tuning/98470/).

Download the [39_barometer_compensation.param parameter file](diatone_taycan_mxc/params/39_barometer_compensation.param) to your PC, edit it with a text editor to meet your needs and in Mission Planner while connected to the vehicle [select *Compare Params*, review the changes and press *Continue* followed by *Uploadd Params*](https://ardupilot.org/planner/docs/mission-planner-configuration-and-tuning.html#full-parameter-list).

Now do the flight to collect the data and analyze the logs to see if the barometer is correctly compensated and insensitive to wind.


# 11. [System Identification Flights](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/systemid-mode-operation.html)

These steps are optional.
Their goal is to build a mathematical model of the vehicle that can later be used to further [optimize the control loops of the vehicle according to a set of constraints (requirements)](https://discuss.ardupilot.org/t/analitical-multicopter-flight-controller-pid-optimization/109759).

# 16. Conclusion

We presented a sequence of small, methodic steps that result in a fully operational and safe drone.
Beginning with informed hardware decisions, appropriate hardware configuration and concluding with a finely tuned vehicle equipped with robust, fast-acting control loops.
Each step is documented in its own intermediate parameter file, ensuring reproducibility and traceability.
Each file is numbered, ensuring that the sequence of steps is clear.
The number of test flights was reduced to a minimum, and their order was optimized.
This process was developed for our specific multicopter, but it can be tailored to any other.

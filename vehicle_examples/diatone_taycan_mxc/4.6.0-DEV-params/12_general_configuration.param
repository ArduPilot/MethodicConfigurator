# Accel filter cutoff frequency
# Filter cutoff frequency for accelerometers. This can be set to a lower value to try to cope with very
# high vibration levels in aircraft. A value of zero means no filtering (not recommended!)

# IMU accelerometer X position
# X position of the first IMU Accelerometer in body frame. Positive X is forward of the origin. Attention:
# The IMU should be located as close to the vehicle c.g. as practical so that the value of this parameter
# is minimised. Failure to do so can result in noisy navigation velocity measurements due to vibration and
# IMU gyro noise. If the IMU cannot be moved and velocity noise is a problem, a location closer to the IMU
# can be used as the body frame origin.

# Accel filter cutoff frequency
# Filter cutoff frequency for accelerometers. This can be set to a lower value to try to cope with very
# high vibration levels in aircraft. A value of zero means no filtering (not recommended!)
# Units: Hz (hertz)
# Range: 0 256
# Default: 20
INS_ACCEL_FILTER,10  # the default is 20 and that lets too much noise in

# IMU accelerometer X position
# X position of the first IMU Accelerometer in body frame. Positive X is forward of the origin. Attention:
# The IMU should be located as close to the vehicle c.g. as practical so that the value of this parameter
# is minimised. Failure to do so can result in noisy navigation velocity measurements due to vibration and
# IMU gyro noise. If the IMU cannot be moved and velocity noise is a problem, a location closer to the IMU
# can be used as the body frame origin.

# Land alt low

# Increment: 10

LAND_ALT_LOW,200  # come down fast and only slow down close to the ground. We have a good GNSS receiver, so thrust it

# RTL Altitude
# The minimum alt above home the vehicle will climb to before returning.  If the vehicle is flying higher
# than this value it will return at its current altitude.
# Units: cm (centimeters)
# Range: 200 300000
# Increment: 1
# Default: 1500
RTL_ALT,300  # The default is too high for the kind of flights we do. This reduces the altitude for indoors

# Default: 5000
RTL_LOIT_TIME,1000  # The default is too long. This reduces the time

# Scheduling main loop rate

# Board Orientation
# Overall board orientation relative to the standard orientation for the board type. This rotates the IMU
# and compass readings to allow the board to be oriented in your vehicle at any 90 or 45 degree angle. The
# label for each option is specified in the order of rotations for that orientation. This option takes
# affect on next boot. After changing you will need to re-level your vehicle. Firmware versions 4.2 and
# prior can use a CUSTOM (100) rotation to set the AHRS_CUSTOM_ROLL/PIT/YAW angles for AHRS orientation.
# Later versions provide two general custom rotations which can be used, Custom 1 and Custom 2, with
# CUST_ROT1_ROLL/PIT/YAW or CUST_ROT2_ROLL/PIT/YAW angles.

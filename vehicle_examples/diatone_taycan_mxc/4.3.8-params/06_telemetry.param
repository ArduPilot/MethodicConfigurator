# Serial 1 flow control
# Enable flow control on serial 1 (telemetry 1). You must have the RTS and CTS pins connected to your
# radio. The standard DF13 6 pin connector for a 3DR radio does have those pins connected. If this is set
# to 2 then flow control will be auto-detected by checking for the output buffer filling on startup. Note
# that the PX4v1 does not have hardware flow control pins on this port, so you should leave this disabled.
# RebootRequired: True
# 0: Disabled
# 1: Enabled
# 2: Auto
# Default: 2
BRD_SER1_RTSCTS,0  # we have no RTS/CTS pins connected

# Telem1 Baud Rate
# The baud rate used on the Telem1 port. Most stm32-based boards can support rates of up to 1500. If you
# setup a rate you cannot support and then can't connect to your board you should load a firmware from a
# different vehicle type. That will reset all your parameters to defaults.

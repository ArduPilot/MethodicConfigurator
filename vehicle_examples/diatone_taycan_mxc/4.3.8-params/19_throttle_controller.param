# Throttle Mix Manual
# Throttle vs attitude control prioritisation used during manual flight (higher values mean we prioritise
# attitude control over throttle)
# Range: 0.1 0.9
# Default: 0.1
ATC_THR_MIX_MAN,0.5  # because we have learned the MOT_THST_HOVER value

# Thrust Hover Value
# Motor thrust needed to hover expressed as a number from 0 to 1
# Range: 0.2 0.8
# Default: 0.35
MOT_THST_HOVER,0.2  # Automatically learned "hover throttle" in ALTHOLD flight mode and HOVER_LEARN == 2

# Acceleration (vertical) controller I gain
# Acceleration (vertical) controller I gain.  Corrects long-term difference in desired vertical
# acceleration and actual acceleration
# Range: 0.000 3.000
# Default: 1
PSC_ACCZ_I,0.4  # 2 â€¢ MOT_THST_HOVER

# Acceleration (vertical) controller P gain
# Acceleration (vertical) controller P gain.  Converts the difference between desired vertical acceleration
# and actual acceleration into a motor output
# Range: 0.200 1.500
# Increment: 0.05
# Default: 0.5
PSC_ACCZ_P,0.2  # MOT_THST_HOVER

# Vehicle Configuration Directory Selection Sub-Application Architecture

## Overview

The Vehicle Configuration Directory Selection sub-application allows users to either create a new vehicle
configuration project or open an existing one. It manages the selection and creation of vehicle directories,
handles template selection, and downloads parameter documentation metadata corresponding to the flight
controller firmware version to the project directory.

The architecture follows a clean layered design with dependency injection, where the frontend components
depend on the VehicleProjectManager factory/container class, which provides a unified interface to all
backend services. This ensures loose coupling and better testability.

## Architecture

### Architectural Pattern

The directory selection sub-application follows a **Factory/Container Pattern** with **Dependency Injection**:

- **Frontend Layer**: GUI components (`VehicleProjectOpenerWindow`, `VehicleProjectCreatorWindow`, `DirectorySelectionWidgets`)
- **Facade Layer**: `VehicleProjectManager` - provides unified interface to all backend services
- **Backend Layer**: Specialized services (`LocalFilesystem`, project creators, openers, etc.)

This architecture ensures:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has distinct responsibilities
- **Dependency Inversion**: Frontend depends on abstractions, not concrete implementations
- **Testability**: Easy to mock dependencies for unit testing
- **Maintainability**: Changes to backend services don't affect frontend code

### Data Flow

The data flow follows the layered architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Application Initialization**
   - VehicleProjectManager is instantiated with required backend services
   - VehicleProjectOpenerWindow receives VehicleProjectManager instance via dependency injection
   - Recent directories and templates are loaded through VehicleProjectManager
   - UI components are initialized with project manager reference

2. **Project Selection Flow**
   - User interacts with VehicleProjectOpenerWindow main interface
   - Three options presented: Create New, Open Existing, Re-open Last Used
   - For new projects: VehicleProjectOpenerWindow launches VehicleProjectCreatorWindow
   - For existing projects: callback functions handle directory selection through VehicleDirectorySelectionWidgets

3. **New Project Creation Flow**
   - VehicleProjectCreatorWindow instantiated with project_manager reference
   - Frontend presents template selection and project configuration options
   - User selects template through TemplateOverviewWindow integration
   - Frontend delegates to `project_manager.create_new_vehicle_from_template()`
   - VehicleProjectManager coordinates with project creator services
   - Project creation delegated to specialized creator services
   - Success/failure feedback provided through manager interface

4. **Existing Project Opening Flow**
   - User interacts with VehicleProjectOpenerWindow
   - Frontend presents project opening and re-opening options
   - User selects existing directory through DirectorySelectionWidgets with callbacks
   - Callback functions call `project_manager.open_vehicle_directory()` or `project_manager.open_last_vehicle_directory()`
   - VehicleProjectManager validates directory through opener services
   - Project state is reconstructed and validated
   - Error handling managed through consistent interface

5. **Architecture Benefits**
   - Frontend never directly accesses backend services
   - All business logic centralized in VehicleProjectManager
   - Easy to test with mock VehicleProjectManager
   - Changes to backend services don't affect frontend code
   - Clean separation between project opening and project creation concerns

### Integration Points

The directory selection sub-application integrates with other components through the VehicleProjectManager interface:

- **Main Application (`__main__.py`)**: Creates VehicleProjectManager and launches VehicleProjectOpenerWindow
- **Flight Controller Communication**: VehicleProjectManager receives firmware information
- **Component Editor**: Receives project instance from VehicleProjectManager
- **Parameter Editor**: Gets configuration and documentation through VehicleProjectManager
- **Template System**: Accessed through VehicleProjectManager template methods
- **File Operations**: All file system access goes through VehicleProjectManager facade

### Dependency Management

The architecture implements **Dependency Inversion Principle**:

```text
Frontend (GUI) → VehicleProjectManager (Interface) → Backend Services
```

**Dependencies Flow:**

- Frontend depends on VehicleProjectManager interface (abstraction)
- VehicleProjectManager depends on backend service interfaces
- Backend services implement concrete functionality
- No direct dependencies between frontend and backend services

**Benefits:**

- Easy unit testing with mock VehicleProjectManager
- Backend services can be replaced without frontend changes
- Clear separation of concerns across layers
- Reduced coupling between components

### Template Management

#### Template Structure

Templates are organized hierarchically by vehicle type:

```text
vehicle_templates/
├── ArduCopter/
│   ├── X-Quadcopter/
│   ├── Y6-Hexacopter/
│   └── Traditional-Helicopter/
├── ArduPlane/
│   ├── Fixed-Wing/
│   └── VTOL/
└── Rover/
    ├── 4WD/
    └── Boat/
```

#### Template Content

Each template contains:

- Parameter files (*.param) for configuration steps
- Vehicle component configuration (vehicle_components.json)
- Configuration step definitions
- Documentation and readme files
- Default parameter values

### Error Handling Strategy

- **Directory Access Errors**: Provide clear guidance for permission issues
- **Template Corruption**: Validate templates and provide recovery options
- **Network Errors**: Handle documentation download failures gracefully
- **File System Errors**: Provide detailed error information and recovery steps

### Testing Strategy

The layered architecture enables comprehensive testing at each level:

#### Unit Testing

- **VehicleProjectManager**: Test facade methods with mocked backend services
- **Frontend Components**: Test with mocked VehicleProjectManager interface
- **Backend Services**: Test in isolation with mocked dependencies
- **Integration Points**: Test VehicleProjectManager coordination logic

#### Test Fixtures and Mocking

- `mock_project_manager`: Mock VehicleProjectManager for frontend tests
- `mock_local_filesystem`: Mock backend services for manager tests
- Dependency injection enables easy test isolation
- Clear interfaces make mocking straightforward

#### Test Coverage Areas

- Directory validation through VehicleProjectManager interface
- Template operations via manager facade methods
- Error handling across architecture layers
- UI interactions with mocked manager dependencies
- File system operations through abstracted interfaces

#### Architecture Testing Benefits

- **Isolation**: Each layer tested independently
- **Maintainability**: Tests don't break when backend implementation changes
- **Clarity**: Test focus matches architectural responsibilities
- **Reliability**: Mock interfaces provide consistent test behavior

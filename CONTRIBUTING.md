# Support

## How to make a good bug report

* Make sure your bug is not a support issue. Support issues should go to [the support forums](http://discuss.ardupilot.org/t/new-ardupilot-methodic-configurator-gui/115038/1) and include a `.bin` log file and a `.zip` file with all the intermediate `.param` files if possible. If you're not sure you have a bug, you should seek support first.
* Search for your bug, and make sure it is [not already reported](https://github.com/ArduPilot/MethodicConfigurator/issues). If it is already reported, comment on that issue.
* Only report one bug per issue report.
* Write a clear and concise summary. Be specific about what component of the software you are writing about, and follow the convention: "Copter: blah blah blah"
* Write a clear and concise description, with **particularly clear steps** to reproduce the problem. Include logs that display the bug. **Try to report only facts in your issue report, keeping your assumptions out of it.**
* The majority of issues open now are good or acceptable by these guidelines. Please refer to them for examples.

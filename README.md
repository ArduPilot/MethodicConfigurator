Amilcar Lucas's ArduPilot Methodic Configurator is a software that semi-automates a [clear, proven and safe configuration sequence for ArduCopter drones](https://ardupilot.github.io/MethodicConfigurator/TUNING_GUIDE_ArduCopter).

- **clear**: the sequence is linear, executed one step at the time with no hidden complex dependencies
- **proven**: the software has been used by hundreds of ArduPilot developers and users. From beginners to advanced. On big and small vehicles.
- **safe**: the sequence reduces trial-and-error and aims at reducing the amount of flights required to configure the vehicle

![When to use ArduPilot Methodic Configurator](images/when_to_use_amc.png)

It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for managing and visualizing ArduPilot parameters, parameter files and documentation.

![Application Screenshot](images/App_screenshot1.png)

We are working on extending it to [ArduPlane](https://ardupilot.github.io/MethodicConfigurator/TUNING_GUIDE_ArduPlane), [Heli](https://ardupilot.github.io/MethodicConfigurator/TUNING_GUIDE_Heli) and [Rover](https://ardupilot.github.io/MethodicConfigurator/TUNING_GUIDE_Rover) vehicles.
But for those it is still very incomplete.

Our Aim
-------

ArduPilot Methodic Configurator aims to enable the creation and use of
trusted, traceable and clear configuration sequences for autonomous,
unmanned vehicle systems for the peaceful benefit of all.

Our Team
--------

The ArduPilot Methodic Configurator team can be global. It can consist
of the Development Team plus many contributors, from many fields and
many places. By choosing to be part of the ArduPilot Methodic
Configurator Development Team, you choose to accept this Code of Conduct.

Our Pledge
----------

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
developers and maintainers pledge to:

- Endeavor to make participation in our project and our community a
  harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
  size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level
  of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or
  sexual identity and orientation.
- Endeavor to understand the intent of development activities they
  undertake, where there may be reason to think that the vehicle may
  be used as a weapon or in an application where it is effectively in
  control of human life.
- Not knowingly support or facilitate the weaponization of systems
  using ArduPilot or ArduPilot Methodic Configurator
- ArduPilot and ArduPilot Methodic Configurator are NOT certified for
  use in applications where ArduPilot is effectively in control of human
  lives. Members of the development team must not knowingly assist in
  projects where ArduPilot will be in control of human lives.
  “In control of human lives” includes but isn’t limited to manned
  aircraft.

- Modifying ArduPilot Methodic Configurator code to intentionally support
  weaponization
- Knowingly designing, testing or using weaponized systems running

- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in

Our Responsibilities
--------------------

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of
acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair
corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit,
or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other
contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban
temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they
deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Scope
-----

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public
spaces when an individual is representing the ArduPilot Methodic
Configurator project or its community. Examples of representing the
ArduPilot Methodic Configurator project or community include using an
official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media
account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline
event. Representation of the ArduPilot Methodic Configurator project
may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

In addition, the rules regarding weaponization and manned vehicles using
ArduPilot apply regardless of whether you are representing the ArduPilot
project at the time.

Enforcement
-----------

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior, and
other actions not consistent with this Code of Conduct may be reported
by contacting the project team at <ardupilot.devel@gmail.com>. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a
response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to
the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement
policies may be posted separately. Project maintainers who do not follow
or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or
permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project’s
leadership team.
